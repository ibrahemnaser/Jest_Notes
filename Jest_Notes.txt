/* Introduction */

* Unit test is an approach that depends on slicing the software into small testable pieces called (Unit).

* Unit test is written by developers.
* Unit test is for testing:
    1- one method
    2- one class
    3- one module
    4- one procedure

* Unit test advantages:
    1- Quality of code and design
    2- Find issues and bugs early (time and money)
    3- Documentation

* Tests types:
    1- Unit test (Every single testable unit separately)
    2- Integration test (Test all units after integration with each other)
    3- End-End test (Final end-user simulation)

* TDD approach:
    1- Write the test first
    2- Think about the code functionality to pass the test
    3- write the code
    4- test it

* Testing cycle:
    1- define the testable unit
    2- give input to the function
    3- define the expected output
    4- check for the output (success/failure)
    5- succeeded ===> DONE 
    6- failed ===> refactor the unit (fix) and repeat the test
